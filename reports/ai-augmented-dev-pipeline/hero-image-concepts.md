## 1. Overview

**Section title:** AI-Augmented Development Pipelines — Overview

**Core concept:** A single pipeline where automated checks and a first-pass assistant run in parallel, but the final gate is always human: developer and reviewer in control, no autonomous merge.

**Visual metaphor:** A river that splits into two channels (CI and PR-assist) then rejoins at a single gate—a small bridge or sluice—with a figure (human) at the gate holding a key or lever.

**Composition description:** Horizontal flow left to right. The “river” is a soft pencil line; the fork is gentle, not mechanical. The gate is a simple arch or barrier. One small figure stands at the gate. Quiet, diagrammatic, not busy.

**Foreground elements:** The gate/bridge, the single human figure, the converging pencil lines of the two channels.

**Background elements:** Faint suggestion of landscape (low hills or horizon line), enough to ground the metaphor without detail.

**Labels:** None, or one very subtle pencil label “human gate” only if needed for clarity.

**Suggested image prompt:** Pencil sketch, hand-drawn style, white paper. A stream splits into two parallel channels then meets again at a small stone bridge; a single figure stands on the bridge. Soft pencil shading, no colour except light grey. Engineering report style, minimal, calm.

## 2. PR Review (AI-Augmented)

**Section title:** PR Review (AI-Augmented)

**Core concept:** The bot sees only the diff and adds margin notes; the human reviewer holds the pen that approves or rejects. Comments, not control.

**Visual metaphor:** A manuscript or scroll with a margin. One set of notes in a different “hand” (the bot’s first pass) in the margin; a second hand holds a pencil and is about to add or correct a note—the human reviewer.

**Composition description:** Slightly angled view of a single page or scroll. Left: block of “text” suggested by ruled lines. Right margin: shorter pencil lines (marginalia). A hand with a pencil enters from the side, suggesting the human adding or approving.

**Foreground elements:** The page/scroll, marginal pencil lines, one human hand with pencil.

**Background elements:** Desk or surface implied by a single edge line; otherwise empty.

**Labels:** None.

**Suggested image prompt:** Pencil drawing on textured paper. Old manuscript or scroll with ruled lines and marginal notes in two different pencil “hands”; a human hand holding a pencil adds a note in the margin. Hand-sketched, light shading, no typography, professional report style.

## 3. Refactoring (AI-Assisted)

**Section title:** Refactoring (AI-Assisted)

**Core concept:** Incremental, rule-based improvement: suggestions applied by hand, then verified by a fixed set of checks (CI). No big-bang; small, ordered steps.

**Visual metaphor:** A stone path or staircase being repaired: one stone at a time, with a checklist or ruler laid alongside to verify alignment.

**Composition description:** A short flight of steps or a path of irregular stones. One stone is lifted or newly placed; a simple ruler or straightedge lies beside it. No machinery—only hand and tool.

**Foreground elements:** The steps or path stones, one stone in focus, a ruler or gauge.

**Background elements:** Faint suggestion of more path or landscape receding; soft pencil only.

**Labels:** None.

**Suggested image prompt:** Pencil sketch, hand-drawn. A stone path or staircase with one stone being adjusted; a ruler or straightedge beside it. Incremental repair, one step at a time. Light pencil, white paper, minimal shading, technical report aesthetic.

## 4. Migration Intelligence (PHP / WP / Plugins)

**Section title:** Migration Intelligence (PHP / WP / Plugins)

**Core concept:** Understanding what breaks and in what order before moving: analysis and a runbook drafted from code context, then execution in small, ordered steps.

**Visual metaphor:** A map with a route marked in segments—numbered or ordered—and a separate “legend” or runbook as a small folded sheet or index card beside the map.

**Composition description:** A single sheet suggesting a map: a path or route broken into segments (simple numbered dots or dashes). Beside it, a smaller folded paper or card implying the runbook. No literal code or UI.

**Foreground elements:** The map-like route, the segment markers, the runbook card.

**Background elements:** Soft outline of “territory” or border; minimal.

**Labels:** Optional tiny numerals (1, 2, 3) on the route; no other text.

**Suggested image prompt:** Pencil drawing. A hand-drawn map with a route divided into clear segments and a small folded runbook or checklist beside it. Ordered journey, planning before execution. Pencil on white paper, light shading, report style.

## 5. Test Generation (AI-Assisted)

**Section title:** Test Generation (AI-Assisted)

**Core concept:** Suggestions for tests are drafted; a human edits and signs off. Coverage grows by curated addition, not automatic generation.

**Visual metaphor:** A net or grid being mended: new strands are added by hand to fill gaps, with a pair of hands (or a single hand) tying or weaving a strand into place.

**Composition description:** A portion of a net or grid—suggested by crossing pencil lines—with a gap and one or two new strands being woven in. Focus on the act of adding and securing, not on the whole net.

**Foreground elements:** The net/grid, the new strand, hands or a tool (e.g. needle) completing the weave.

**Background elements:** Faint continuation of the net or empty space; no literal “code” or screens.

**Labels:** None.

**Suggested image prompt:** Pencil sketch. A hand mending a net or grid—adding a strand to fill a gap. Hand-sketched lines, light pencil shading, white paper. Metaphor for filling coverage gaps with human-curated additions. Calm, technical report style.

## 6. Documentation (AI-Assisted)

**Section title:** Documentation (AI-Assisted)

**Core concept:** Drafts are generated from context; a human revises and approves. Docs stay in sync through deliberate updates, not autonomous pushes.

**Visual metaphor:** A book or ledger open to a page being updated: one hand holds a pencil and edits a line; the other hand (or the edge of the page) suggests the “source” (code/config) as a smaller note or reference.

**Composition description:** Open book or ledger in soft perspective. One page has a few ruled lines; a hand with a pencil edits one line. A small slip of paper or margin suggests reference material. Quiet, studious.

**Foreground elements:** The open book, the edited line, the pencil, optional reference slip.

**Background elements:** Desk or surface; minimal.

**Labels:** None, or a single minimal mark to suggest “updated”.

**Suggested image prompt:** Pencil drawing. Open book or ledger with a hand editing a line in pencil; a small reference note nearby. Human revising a draft. Hand-sketched, light shading, white or textured paper, professional tone.

## 7. Tooling Comparison (OSS vs SaaS)

**Section title:** Tooling Comparison (OSS vs SaaS)

**Core concept:** Two categories of tools—one self-contained and local (OSS / no AI cost), one external and capped (SaaS)—feeding the same pipeline under a budget.

**Visual metaphor:** Two streams or conduits (one labelled by context as “own water”, one as “metered supply”) feeding into a single basin or reservoir with a simple gauge or marker for “limit”.

**Composition description:** Two parallel conduits or channels—suggested by pencil lines—converging into one vessel. A simple level line or gauge on the vessel indicates a cap. No logos or product imagery.

**Foreground elements:** The two conduits, the single vessel, the gauge/limit line.

**Background elements:** Neutral ground; no extra detail.

**Labels:** Optional: very small “OSS” and “capped” (or similar) in pencil, only if needed.

**Suggested image prompt:** Pencil sketch. Two hand-drawn channels or pipes feeding into one container with a clear “max” level marked. Metaphor for OSS + capped SaaS feeding one pipeline. Light pencil, white paper, diagrammatic, report style.

## 8. Governance and Controls

**Section title:** Governance and Controls

**Core concept:** Clear boundaries around what data can leave; controls (policy, redaction, approval, deployment checklist) guard the perimeter.

**Visual metaphor:** A garden or courtyard with a low wall and a single gate. Inside: “safe” area (suggested by order or clarity). Outside: no detail, just implied “beyond”. A figure stands at the gate with a checklist or key.

**Composition description:** Low wall and gate in pencil; interior suggested by a few ordered elements (e.g. paths, one tree). The gate is the only opening. One figure at the gate, back or side view, holding a small list or key.

**Foreground elements:** Wall, gate, figure at gate, optional checklist.

**Background elements:** Interior order; exterior left vague.

**Labels:** None, or one subtle “boundary” if needed.

**Suggested image prompt:** Pencil drawing. A walled garden or courtyard with one gate; a figure at the gate with a checklist. Metaphor for data boundaries and controlled access. Hand-sketched, light shading, white paper, no cartoon style.

## 9. 90-Day Roadmap

**Section title:** 90-Day Roadmap

**Core concept:** A fixed horizon in three phases: foundation, then optional trials, then review and decision. Time is explicit and bounded.

**Visual metaphor:** A path or timeline as a single ribbon or strip divided into three segments, with simple landmarks in each (e.g. a post, a gate, a flag). One figure walks the path or stands at the first milestone.

**Composition description:** Horizontal ribbon or path in pencil, clearly divided into three parts. Minimal landmarks—post, gate, flag—in each part. Small figure at the start or at the first divide. No calendar UI.

**Foreground elements:** The three segments, the landmarks, the figure.

**Background elements:** Slight suggestion of landscape or horizon; minimal.

**Labels:** Optional: “0–30”, “30–60”, “60–90” in very small pencil only if needed.

**Suggested image prompt:** Pencil sketch. A path or ribbon in three segments with simple milestones; a single figure at the first segment. 90-day pilot as a journey. Hand-drawn, light shading, white paper, report style.

## 10. KPIs and Risks

**Section title:** KPIs and Risks

**Core concept:** A few measurable outcomes and a set of hard stop conditions: what is measured, and what triggers pause or review.

**Visual metaphor:** A balance or pair of scales: on one side, a small stack of “measures” (e.g. ruled cards or tokens); on the other, a small stack of “triggers” (similar but distinct). A hand holds a pencil or pointer, suggesting review.

**Composition description:** Simple balance—two pans or trays—with abstract “items” on each side (e.g. small rectangles or tokens). One hand with pencil or pointer near the balance, suggesting reading or deciding. No literal numbers or dials.

**Foreground elements:** The balance, the two sets of tokens/cards, the hand with pencil.

**Background elements:** Desk or surface; otherwise empty.

**Labels:** Optional: “measure” and “trigger” in tiny pencil; no numerals.

**Suggested image prompt:** Pencil drawing. A hand-drawn balance with small tokens or cards on each side; a hand with a pencil reviews the balance. Metaphor for KPIs and stop conditions. Light pencil, white paper, minimal shading, technical report style.

## Style reminder (all sections)

- **Medium:** Pencil on white or lightly textured paper.
- **Line:** Hand-sketched, not vector-perfect.
- **Colour:** Pencil plus light colour wash only — soft grey lines, very light cream or sepia tint, minimal pale blue or warm grey accents; no saturated or digital colour.
- **Tone:** Calm, professional, suitable for engineering/technical reports.
- **Avoid:** Literal screens, UIs, robots, cartoon faces, exaggerated tech (gears, glowing chips), marketing flair.
- **Emphasise:** Symbolic metaphors, human-in-control, gates and boundaries, ordered steps, and clarity of concept over literal representation.
