## 8. Recommended Structure for Specifications and Examples

### 8.1 High-Level Structure (Spec Kit Style)

A single feature or initiative can live under a feature directory, e.g.:

```text
specs/
  <feature-branch-or-id>/
    spec.md           # What and why; user stories; acceptance criteria
    plan.md           # Technical plan; architecture; contracts
    tasks.md          # Ordered task list (with [P] for parallel where applicable)
    research.md       # Optional: technical research, options, decisions
    data-model.md     # Optional: entities, schemas
    contracts/        # Optional: API contracts, events
    quickstart.md     # Optional: key validation scenarios
```

- **spec.md** — Product-level: users, goals, acceptance criteria, no implementation detail.
- **plan.md** — Technical: stack, components, data model, APIs, test strategy; can reference `implementation-details/` for depth.
- **tasks.md** — Execution: small, testable tasks; agent or human implements in order (or in parallel groups).

### 8.2 Spec Template (What to Include)

Suggested sections for **spec.md** (product spec):

- **Overview** — One paragraph: what we're building and why.
- **Users / Personas** — Who is affected.
- **User Stories / Scenarios** — "As a … I want … So that …"; can double as scenario tests.
- **Acceptance Criteria** — Testable conditions; can be refined into holdout scenarios.
- **Non-Functional Requirements** — Performance, security, compliance (as needed).
- **Out of Scope** — Explicit exclusions.
- **Uncertainties** — `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` until resolved.

Keep **how** (technology, APIs) out of the product spec; put it in **plan.md**.

### 8.3 Plan Template (What to Include)

Suggested sections for **plan.md** (technical plan):

- **Principles / Constitution** — Reference to project principles and constraints.
- **Architecture** — High-level components, boundaries, integrations.
- **Stack** — Languages, frameworks, services (e.g. PHP 8.x, WordPress 6.x, Laravel 11, MySQL, Redis).
- **Data Model** — Main entities; details can live in `data-model.md`.
- **APIs / Contracts** — Endpoints or events; details in `contracts/`.
- **Test Strategy** — Unit, integration, e2e; relationship to scenarios.
- **Phase gates** — e.g. simplicity, no unnecessary abstraction (Spec Kit–style gates).

### 8.4 Scenario Documentation

Scenarios can live in:

- **quickstart.md** or **scenarios.md** in the feature spec directory (for that feature), or
- A **central scenario repo or folder** used as a holdout set.

Format (example):

```markdown
## Scenario: Editor publishes a scheduled post (WordPress)
- **Actor:** Editor
- **Goal:** Publish a post that was scheduled for today
- **Steps:** Log in → Open Posts → Select scheduled post → Click Publish
- **Expected:** Post is published; appears on site; no errors. [Optional: LLM-as-judge for "acceptable outcome"]
```

### 8.5 Public Examples and References

- **GitHub Spec Kit** — [github.com/github/spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit): templates, `spec-driven.md`, and `AGENTS.md` show spec/plan/task structure and commands.
- **StrongDM Attractor** — [github.com/strongdm/attractor](https://github.com/strongdm/attractor): repo contains **only markdown specs** (e.g. `coding-agent-loop-spec.md`); the implementation is generated by feeding those specs to a coding agent. Good example of "spec as the only source."
- **Anthropic knowledge-work plugins** — [github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins): skills in markdown (e.g. legal); structure is `commands/` and `skills/` with `SKILL.md` files. Useful as a pattern for domain-specific instructions (e.g. "WordPress plugin behaviour" or "Laravel API design").
- **StrongDM Factory** — [factory.strongdm.ai](https://factory.strongdm.ai): principles, techniques (DTU, Gene Transfusion, Shift Work, Semport, Pyramid Summaries), and product descriptions.
- **OpenSpec** — [openspec.dev](https://openspec.dev): lightweight spec-driven framework; specs live in the repo by capability; generates proposal, design, tasks and **spec deltas** so you review intent before code. Native integration with Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot and others; brownfield-first, open source.
