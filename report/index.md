This report summarises research into **Dark Factories** and **AI-generated code** workflows for PHP-based teams (WordPress and Laravel). Each section is available as its own page with subsections; use the sidebar to navigate.

## Report sections

Each section has an illustration at the top of its page. Below, the sections with their images.

In the table below, the first column links to each section, the second column shows the section illustration, and the third column gives a short description. Use the first column to jump to a section.
