Align with organisational principles (constitution).</li><li><strong>Tasks</strong> — Break the plan into small, implementable and testable tasks (optionally marked for parallelisation).</li><li><strong>Implement</strong> — Agent (or human) implements from tasks; validation is against scenarios and tests derived from the spec.</li></ol><p>At each phase, <strong>verify and refine</strong> before moving on: does the spec capture intent?

Use phases (Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement) with explicit checkpoints.</li><li><strong>Constitution / principles:</strong> Maintain a short document of principles (quality, security, stack, patterns). The plan phase should reference it so generated code stays on-brand.</li><li><strong>Ambiguity markers:</strong> In specs, use something like <code>[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]</code> so that assumptions are not hidden; the team (or agent in the next phase) resolves them before implementation.</li></ul><h3 id="_6-3-tools-and-commands-spec-kit-pattern" tabindex="-1">6.3 Tools and Commands (Spec Kit Pattern) <a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-3-tools-and-commands-spec-kit-pattern" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;6.3 Tools and Commands (Spec Kit Pattern)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>GitHub&#39;s Spec Kit illustrates a <strong>command-based</strong> workflow that fits SDD:</p><ul><li><strong><code>/speckit.constitution</code></strong> — Create or update project principles and guidelines.</li><li><strong><code>/speckit.specify</code></strong> — Turn a short feature description into a full spec (with branch/template/structure).</li><li><strong><code>/speckit.plan</code></strong> — Generate a technical plan from the spec and constitution.</li><li><strong><code>/speckit.tasks</code></strong> — Generate a task list from the plan (and related docs).</li><li><strong><code>/speckit.implement</code></strong> — Run implementation (e.g. agent executes tasks).</li></ul><p>Similar flows can be implemented with Cursor rules, Claude Code skills, or internal runbooks.
