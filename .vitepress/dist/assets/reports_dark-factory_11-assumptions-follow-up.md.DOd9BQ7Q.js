This affects how to implement <code>/speckit</code>-style commands or skills.</li><li><strong>Legacy vs greenfield:</strong> What share of work is legacy (N→N+1) vs greenfield? Spec Kit and others suggest spec-driven is especially useful for N→N+1 and legacy modernisation.</li><li><strong>Cost and tokens:</strong> What is an acceptable monthly token/API budget per engineer for agentic workflows?
