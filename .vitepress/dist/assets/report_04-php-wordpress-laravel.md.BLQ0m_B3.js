Writing these as scenarios (and keeping some holdout) improves reliability of AI-generated features.</li><li><strong>Less time on boilerplate:</strong> Forms, CRUD, API endpoints, and WP plugins can be generated from specs; the team spends more time on product and validation than on typing code.</li><li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Shared spec templates and &quot;constitution&quot; (principles, stack, patterns) help agents produce code that fits your PHP/WordPress/Laravel conventions.</li></ul><h3 id="_4-2-future-proofing" tabindex="-1">4.2 Future-Proofing <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-2-future-proofing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4.2 Future-Proofing&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Intent as durable asset:</strong> Specs and scenarios are technology-agnostic. If you move from one framework or CMS to another, the same intent can drive a new implementation (e.g. &quot;Gene Transfusion&quot; or &quot;Semport&quot; from StrongDM: copy patterns or port behaviour across stacks).</li><li><strong>Portable skills and specs:</strong> Markdown specs and scenario descriptions are readable by any capable model; you are not locked to one vendor. Skills/plugins (e.g. Anthropic&#39;s open-source legal skills) show a pattern: domain knowledge in markdown, usable across tools.</li><li><strong>Progressive adoption:</strong> You can adopt &quot;Dark Factory thinking&quot; incrementally: start with spec-driven feature work and scenario-based acceptance, then increase automation (e.g. more non-interactive runs, less human code review) as confidence grows.</li></ul><h3 id="_4-3-php-wordpress-laravel-specifics" tabindex="-1">4.3 PHP / WordPress / Laravel Specifics <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-3-php-wordpress-laravel-specifics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4.3 PHP / WordPress / Laravel Specifics&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>WordPress:</strong> Specs can describe plugin behaviour, hooks, and user flows; scenarios can cover admin and front-end journeys. Custom post types, taxonomies, and integrations (e.g. Algolia, Campaign Monitor) are good candidates for scenario-based validation.</li><li><strong>Laravel:</strong> Specs can define modules, API contracts, and business rules; scenarios can cover HTTP flows, jobs, and events. Align specs with Laravel conventions (routing, Eloquent, queues) so generated code stays idiomatic.</li><li><strong>Shared:</strong> Use a single &quot;constitution&quot; or principles doc (stack, security, testing, naming) so that both WordPress and Laravel work share the same high-level rules in specs.</li></ul>',8)])])}const h=a(n,[["render",i]]);export{f as __pageData,h as default};
