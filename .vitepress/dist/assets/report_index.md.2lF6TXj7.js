Executive Summary <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-executive-summary" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1. Executive Summary&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This report summarises research into <strong>Dark Factories</strong> and <strong>AI-generated code</strong> workflows. A Dark Factory in software is a development model where <strong>humans do not write or review code</strong>; they write specifications and approve outcomes. AI agents implement from specs, run validation (often scenario-based), and produce shippable artifacts. The research addresses how this can apply to a PHP-based team (WordPress and Laravel) for efficiency and future-proofing, defines <strong>scenario-based development</strong>, and outlines a <strong>recommended approach and structure for specifications</strong>, with pointers to examples and tooling. It also covers <strong>consultancy dynamics</strong>: how these workflows apply when the dev team sits inside a consultancy (e.g. Elixirr), whether developers are at odds with consultants, whether consultants could replace the dev team, and what competitive advantage the development team retains.</p><p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dark Factory</strong> = spec-in, artifact-out; no human code writing or line-by-line review; validation by behaviour (scenarios), not by inspecting code.</li><li><strong>New workflow</strong> centres on: precise specification, scenario/holdout validation, and approval of outcomes rather than diffs.</li><li><strong>Consultancy environment:</strong> Consultants own business specs (what and why); developers own technical plans, scenarios, and operations. The structure does not give consultants power to replace the dev team—both are needed. Developers’ advantages include technical spec precision, validation design, system knowledge, operational ownership, quality judgment, tool/agent mastery, and a faster path to structured spec writing (they get good at implementable specs quicker than other teams). Product/PM roles remain distinct (business spec vs technical plan); account managers sit upstream and around the pipeline (client relationship, scope, commercials), not inside the spec→code chain.</li><li><strong>Scenario-based development</strong> uses end-to-end user stories (scenarios), often held outside the codebase like a holdout set, validated by behaviour (including LLM-as-judge where appropriate).</li><li><strong>Specifications</strong> should be the source of truth: living, executable artifacts that drive implementation. Recommended approach: Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement, with checkpoints and constitution/principles.</li><li><strong>Spec structure</strong> benefits from templates (e.g. Spec Kit, StrongDM-style specs), clear separation of what/why vs how, and versioning alongside code.</li><li><strong>Adoption</strong> (Section 8): workflow changes; where Jira and GitHub sit; skills by level (junior to lead); example constitutions and a draft; agent rules and roles (Spec, Plan, Tasks, Implement, Validate) and coordination via markdown context.</li></ul><p>The report is structured so it can be converted to an HTML microsite or PDF (sections, table of contents, and clear headings).</p><hr><h2 id="_2-what-is-a-dark-factory" tabindex="-1">2.

It operates across practices such as Strategy &amp; Transformation, Operational Excellence, Data &amp; Technology, Digital Experience, and Research &amp; Insights. The consultancy side advises clients on business strategy, transformation roadmaps, and digital opportunity.</p><p>Elixirr Digital (formerly Den Creative) is the in-house product and engineering arm that builds and maintains digital products for clients—including, for example, Dezeen&#39;s websites, server infrastructure, and platforms (WordPress, Laravel, high-traffic publishing). The consultancy side defines <em>what</em> to build and <em>why</em> from a business perspective; the dev team implements, operates, and owns the technical delivery.

This answers <em>what</em> and <em>why</em>.</li><li><strong>Technical specification</strong> (developer output): architecture, data models, API contracts, edge cases, constraints, validation scenarios, constitution/principles. This answers <em>how</em> and <em>does it actually work</em>.</li></ul><p>A Dark Factory needs <em>both</em>. A strategy deck or PRD is not an implementable spec—an agent cannot reliably generate correct, production-ready code from &quot;we want to improve user engagement&quot; without a technical plan that specifies data models, endpoints, and validation. Consultants excel at the former; developers (or engineers who think like developers) are needed for the latter. So consultants do not replace developers; the handoff and division of labour evolve. That said, the boundary is already shifting in practice: at least one consultant is already generating more lines of code with Cursor than most of the dev team combined—a concrete sign that consultants plus AI can narrow the gap and that the dev team’s durable advantages (see 4A.5) matter more than raw output volume.</p><h3 id="_4a-3-collaboration-not-competition-the-spec-driven-value-chain" tabindex="-1">4A.3 Collaboration, Not Competition: The Spec-Driven Value Chain <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4a-3-collaboration-not-competition-the-spec-driven-value-chain" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4A.3 Collaboration, Not Competition: The Spec-Driven Value Chain&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The value chain is better understood as <strong>collaboration</strong> than as zero-sum competition:</p><div class="language-mermaid vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">mermaid</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#E1E4E8;">flowchart LR</span></span>

Developers who stay at Level 2 (pair-programming, reviewing every diff) become bottlenecks rather than multipliers.</li><li><strong>Consultants + AI narrow the gap.</strong> At least one consultant is already generating more lines of code using Cursor than most of the dev team combined. That illustrates how consultants with strong AI-assisted workflows can push further into the plan/task space and produce substantial implementation volume. The boundary between business spec and technical spec is not fixed; it can be moved by upskilling and tooling. The dev team’s response is not to compete on lines of code but to own technical precision, validation, and operations (see 4A.5).</li><li><strong>Junior roles shrink.</strong> Entry-level &quot;write this CRUD endpoint&quot; work is the first to be fully automated. The team needs to plan for different career paths and ways to onboard new engineers (e.g. into spec-writing, scenario design, and operations).</li><li><strong>Industry adoption is accelerating.</strong> Thomson Reuters reports organisation-wide AI adoption in professional services jumped to 40% in 2026 from 22% in 2025. Consultancy firms are adopting AI quickly; the question is whether the dev team leads or follows.</li></ul><h3 id="_4a-5-competitive-advantages-for-the-development-team" tabindex="-1">4A.5 Competitive Advantages for the Development Team <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4a-5-competitive-advantages-for-the-development-team" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4A.5 Competitive Advantages for the Development Team&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Seven durable advantages that consultants (and other non-engineering roles) cannot easily replicate:</p><ol><li><strong>Technical specification precision.</strong> Turning vague business requirements into implementable specs—data models, API contracts, constraints, edge cases—requires engineering experience, not business strategy skills. Agents need this precision to generate correct code.</li><li><strong>Validation and scenario design.</strong> Knowing <em>what to test</em> and <em>how to catch real bugs</em>: holdout scenarios, integration edge cases, security and performance validation. These require deep system knowledge.</li><li><strong>System and domain knowledge.</strong> The existing codebase (e.g. Dezeen: 30,000+ articles, custom plugins, WordPress hooks, Laravel awards platform, Cloudflare/CDN, Algolia search) is accumulated expertise that no consultant or greenfield AI agent starts with.</li><li><strong>Operational ownership.</strong> Production systems need people who understand deployment, monitoring, incident response, caching, performance, and infrastructure. Consultants do not operate production.</li><li><strong>Quality judgment.</strong> Knowing when AI-generated code is architecturally sound versus when it introduces technical debt or subtle bugs. Gartner warns that prompt-to-app approaches could increase software defects significantly by 2028 without engineering oversight.</li><li><strong>Tool and agent mastery.</strong> Configuring Cursor rules, Claude Code skills, agent harnesses, and CI pipelines for AI workflows. The &quot;factory floor&quot; still needs operators who can tune and steer the system.</li><li><strong>Faster path to structured spec writing.</strong> Developers are likely to get good at structured, implementable spec writing <em>quicker</em> than consultants, product owners, or PMs. They already think in terms of constraints, edge cases, data shapes, and what can actually be built—so the gap between &quot;business wish&quot; and &quot;spec an agent can execute&quot; is smaller for them. Other teams can learn, but developers start with the implementation mental model; upskilling them into spec ownership is a shorter journey than teaching non-technical spec authors what &quot;implementable&quot; really means. That makes the dev team the natural owners of the technical-plan layer and the bridge between business intent and agent-ready input.</li></ol><h3 id="_4a-6-the-strategic-play-developers-as-factory-operators" tabindex="-1">4A.6 The Strategic Play: Developers as Factory Operators <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4a-6-the-strategic-play-developers-as-factory-operators" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4A.6 The Strategic Play: Developers as Factory Operators&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Reframing the developer role from &quot;people who write code&quot; to &quot;people who operate the software factory&quot; changes the narrative:</p><ul><li>Developers become <strong>more valuable per person</strong> because each can serve more projects (or consultancy clients) when implementation is AI-assisted. Throughput increases without linear headcount growth.</li><li>The dev team becomes a <strong>force multiplier</strong> for the consultancy: faster turnaround, more concurrent engagements, higher delivery capacity.</li><li><strong>Revenue leverage:</strong> a smaller dev team generating more output is not a threat to the team; it is a higher-margin, more strategic asset for the consultancy group. The value is in outcomes and ownership, not in hours of typing code.</li><li>The real competitive threat is <strong>external</strong>: other consultancies adopting Dark Factory patterns. The advantage goes to the first consultancy whose dev team masters spec-driven, agent-operated workflows and can deliver with speed and quality.</li></ul><h3 id="_4a-7-recommendations-for-the-dezeen-elixirr-digital-team" tabindex="-1">4A.7 Recommendations for the Dezeen / Elixirr Digital Team <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4a-7-recommendations-for-the-dezeen-elixirr-digital-team" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4A.7 Recommendations for the Dezeen / Elixirr Digital Team&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Concrete actions:</p><ul><li><strong>Own the spec pipeline.</strong> Establish the dev team as the authority on technical specs, plans, scenarios, and constitution—not just code. This makes the team indispensable regardless of how code is produced.</li><li><strong>Collaborate with consultancy on business specs.</strong> Build a shared format (e.g. Specify → Plan → Tasks) so handoffs between consultants and developers are clean and repeatable. Define clearly what &quot;business spec&quot; hands off and what &quot;technical plan&quot; the dev team adds.</li><li><strong>Invest in validation.</strong> Scenario design, holdout management, and CI-based satisfaction or pass/fail gates are moats that keep the dev team central. Consultants are unlikely to own this; developers should.</li><li><strong>Level up, don&#39;t dig in.</strong> Move toward Level 4 (spec-driven, outcome-focused approval) rather than defending Level 2 (pair-programming, diff-reviewing). The risk is not AI replacing developers—it is developers who refuse to change being outpaced by those who do.</li></ul><h3 id="_4a-8-product-pm-and-commercial-roles-competition-or-collaboration" tabindex="-1">4A.8 Product, PM, and Commercial Roles: Competition or Collaboration? <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4a-8-product-pm-and-commercial-roles-competition-or-collaboration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4A.8 Product, PM, and Commercial Roles: Competition or Collaboration?&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Developers vs Product Owner / PM.</strong> In a spec-driven world, the question arises: does this put developers in competition with product owners or project/product managers?</p><p>It can look like competition if &quot;who writes the spec?&quot; is seen as a single role. In practice, the pipeline splits cleanly: <strong>PO/PM</strong> own the <em>business</em> spec—backlog, priorities, user stories, acceptance criteria, and &quot;what success looks like&quot; for users and the business. <strong>Developers</strong> own the <em>technical</em> spec—how it is built, data models, contracts, scenarios, and constitution. So PO/PM and devs are complementary: the former define intent and outcomes; the latter make that intent implementable by agents and own validation. There is overlap in &quot;structured spec writing&quot; (both benefit from clear, unambiguous language), but PO/PM bring product and user judgment; developers bring implementability and system boundaries. As long as the handoff is defined (e.g. business spec → technical plan → tasks → implementation), the roles are not in zero-sum competition. The risk is only if one side tries to own the entire chain without the other—e.g. PO/PM writing technical plans without engineering input, or developers writing business requirements without product input. Collaboration on a shared format (Specify → Plan → Tasks) keeps both sides necessary.</p><p><strong>Where the account manager sits.</strong> Account managers sit <strong>upstream and around</strong> the delivery pipeline rather than inside the &quot;spec → code&quot; chain. They own the client relationship, scope, commercials, expectations, and reporting. In the new model: <strong>upstream</strong>, they translate client need into engagements that feed into business specs (often via consultants or PMs). <strong>Around</strong> delivery, they own communication, change control, and client satisfaction—so they care that the pipeline produces the right outcomes on time and within scope, but they do not need to write specs or code. Their role is to keep the commercial and relationship layer intact while the internal chain (consultancy → dev team → agents) does the work.

Epics or stories in Jira link to a spec branch or doc; &quot;Ready for dev&quot; means &quot;spec and acceptance criteria agreed.&quot;</li><li><strong>Plan-before-tasks.</strong> For any non-trivial feature, a technical plan (<code>plan.md</code>) exists and is briefly reviewed before tasks are created or handed to an agent. This keeps architecture and constraints explicit.</li><li><strong>Single source of truth for intent.</strong> Keep one place for &quot;what we&#39;re building and why&quot; (product spec) and one for &quot;how we&#39;re building it&quot; (technical plan). Avoid duplicating intent in Jira descriptions, Confluence, and code comments; link from Jira to the spec repo or <code>specs/</code> in the codebase.</li><li><strong>Scenarios as acceptance.</strong> Define at least a small set of end-to-end scenarios per feature (or epic) and run them before marking &quot;Done.&quot; Prefer scenarios in a shared format (e.g. <code>scenarios.md</code> or a scenario repo) so they can double as holdout validation for agent-generated work.</li><li><strong>Outcome review, not only diff review.</strong> For agent-generated changes, add a checkpoint: &quot;Do scenarios pass? Does the outcome match the spec?&quot; in addition to (or instead of) line-by-line code review for low-risk, well-specified work.</li><li><strong>Constitution in the loop.</strong> Every technical plan references the team constitution (stack, security, testing, naming). New engineers and agents read the constitution before generating plans or code. Review plans for constitution compliance.</li><li><strong>Short retrospectives on spec quality.</strong> Periodically ask: &quot;Did the spec/plan reduce rework or cause it?&quot; Use that to refine templates and the constitution.</li></ul><h3 id="_8-2-where-jira-atlassian-cloud-and-github-sit" tabindex="-1">8.2 Where Jira (Atlassian Cloud) and GitHub Sit <a class="header-anchor" href="#_8-2-where-jira-atlassian-cloud-and-github-sit" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;8.2 Where Jira (Atlassian Cloud) and GitHub Sit&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Jira (Atlassian Cloud)</strong> — Backlog, prioritisation, and traceability:</p><ul><li><strong>Epics / initiatives</strong> map to a business goal; link to a high-level product spec or Confluence doc if the full spec lives there, or to a GitHub branch/repo that holds <code>specs/&lt;feature&gt;/</code>.</li><li><strong>Stories / tasks</strong> should reference the spec: e.g. &quot;Spec: <code>specs/003-search-filters/spec.md</code>&quot; or a link to the branch. &quot;Definition of Ready&quot; can include &quot;Spec exists and is agreed; plan exists for non-trivial work.&quot;</li><li><strong>Status and acceptance</strong> — &quot;Done&quot; is gated by scenario pass (or explicit sign-off) and optionally by a PR that implements the spec. Jira stays the place for prioritisation, assignment, and reporting; it does not replace the spec as the source of truth for <em>what</em> is being built.</li><li><strong>Integration</strong> — Use Jira–GitHub integration (or equivalent) so commits/PRs can link to Jira issues. Branches can follow a convention (e.g. <code>spec/DEZ-123-search-filters</code>) so Jira and GitHub stay in sync.</li></ul><p><strong>GitHub</strong> — Code, specs, and agent workflow:</p><ul><li><strong>Specs</strong> can live in the same repo as code (e.g. <code>specs/</code> at repo root) or in a dedicated &quot;specs&quot; repo. Either way, version specs with the code (same branch or linked branch) so &quot;what we built&quot; and &quot;what we said we&#39;d build&quot; are traceable.</li><li><strong>Branches</strong> — Feature work happens on branches. Specs, plan, and tasks live in that branch (e.g. <code>specs/&lt;feature-id&gt;/</code>). The agent (Cursor, Claude Code, or CI job) reads from that branch and writes code on the same branch.</li><li><strong>Pull requests</strong> — PRs reference the spec (link or path) and optionally the Jira ticket. Description can include &quot;Implements <code>specs/003-search-filters/spec.md</code>; scenarios: see <code>specs/003-search-filters/scenarios.md</code>.&quot; Review focuses on outcome and constitution compliance for agent-generated PRs where appropriate.</li><li><strong>CI/CD</strong> — Run scenario checks (or a subset) in CI. Block merge if holdout scenarios fail. GitHub Actions (or similar) can run spec-derived tests and mark status on the PR.</li><li><strong>Constitution and agent context</strong> — Store <code>constitution.md</code> (or equivalent) in the repo. Cursor rules, Claude Code skills, or Copilot instructions can reference it. A small script or docs can sync key principles into agent-specific files (e.g. <code>.cursor/rules</code>, <code>.claude/skills</code>) so every agent run sees the same constraints.</li></ul><p>In short: <strong>Jira</strong> = what we’re doing and when (backlog, status, commercials); <strong>GitHub</strong> = what we’re building and how (specs, code, PRs, CI).

Then:</p><ul><li>Reference it from every <code>plan.md</code> (e.g. &quot;This plan respects the project constitution.&quot;).</li><li>Add it to Cursor rules or Claude Code skills so agents load it.</li><li>Review it in retros and update it when the team agrees a principle has changed.</li></ul><p>A constitution for the <strong>company</strong> (e.g. Elixirr-wide) might be a shorter, higher-level document (e.g. &quot;We use spec-driven development; all technical plans reference the relevant product constitution; we do not commit secrets&quot;). Individual products or teams can then have a more detailed constitution that inherits or references the company one.</p><h3 id="_8-5-agent-rules-roles-and-context-markdown" tabindex="-1">8.5 Agent Rules, Roles, and Context (Markdown) <a class="header-anchor" href="#_8-5-agent-rules-roles-and-context-markdown" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;8.5 Agent Rules, Roles, and Context (Markdown)&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Do we need specific agent rules?</strong> Yes. Agent rules (Cursor rules, Claude Code skills, or Copilot instructions) are what make the workflow repeatable and safe: they load the right context (constitution, stack, templates) and constrain output so generated code and specs stay aligned with the team. Without rules, each run is ad hoc and quality drifts.</p><p><strong>What kind of agents and roles?</strong> You can think in two ways: (1) <strong>roles as phases</strong> — the same tool (e.g. Cursor) is used with different context per phase; or (2) <strong>roles as specialised agents</strong> — separate prompts or subagents for spec, plan, implement, validate. For most teams, (1) is enough: one coding agent that receives different markdown context depending on the phase.</p><p>A practical set of roles that can be implemented as <strong>rules + which .md files are in context</strong>:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Role / phase</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Context (what the agent sees)</th><th>Output</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Spec</strong></td><td>Turn a short brief into a full product spec.</td><td>Constitution, spec template, (optional) existing spec.</td><td><code>spec.md</code> (and branch/folder).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Plan</strong></td><td>Turn spec into technical plan.</td><td>Constitution, spec.md, plan template, (optional) architecture docs.</td><td><code>plan.md</code>, optionally <code>data-model.md</code>, <code>contracts/</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tasks</strong></td><td>Break plan into implementable tasks.</td><td>Constitution, spec.md, plan.md, tasks template.</td><td><code>tasks.md</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Implement</strong></td><td>Implement from tasks; write or edit code.</td><td>Constitution, spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, (optional) scenarios for “do not break.”</td><td>Code changes, tests; PR.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Validate</strong></td><td>Check outcome vs spec and scenarios.</td><td>spec.md, scenarios.md, (optional) plan.md; access to run tests or scenario runner.</td><td>Pass/fail, or list of gaps.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These can all be <strong>one agent</strong> (e.g. Cursor or Claude Code) with different rules or slash-commands that inject the right files. For example: “When doing /speckit.specify, always load constitution.md and the spec template; when doing /speckit.implement, always load constitution.md, spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md.”</p><p><strong>Can this be coordinated between roles and passed context from .md files?</strong> Yes. The whole pipeline can be coordinated by <strong>which markdown files are passed as context</strong> at each step. No separate orchestration engine is required:</p><ul><li><strong>Constitution</strong> (<code>constitution.md</code>) — Loaded for every role so stack, quality, and AI-use rules apply everywhere.</li><li><strong>Spec</strong> (<code>specs/&lt;feature&gt;/spec.md</code>) — Loaded for Plan, Tasks, Implement, and Validate so intent is never lost.</li><li><strong>Plan</strong> (<code>specs/&lt;feature&gt;/plan.md</code>) — Loaded for Tasks, Implement, and optionally Validate so “how” is explicit.</li><li><strong>Tasks</strong> (<code>specs/&lt;feature&gt;/tasks.md</code>) — Loaded for Implement so the agent knows exactly what to do next.</li><li><strong>Scenarios</strong> (<code>specs/&lt;feature&gt;/scenarios.md</code> or a central <code>scenarios/</code>) — Loaded for Validate; for Implement you may pass only “do not break these” or hide holdout scenarios so the agent cannot game them.</li></ul><p><strong>How to implement:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cursor:</strong> Use project or folder-level rules (e.g. <code>.cursor/rules/*.mdc</code> or a single rule file) that reference the constitution and, per phase, which paths to include. A rule might say: “For implementation tasks, always read <code>specs/&lt;feature&gt;/spec.md</code>, <code>plan.md</code>, and <code>tasks.md</code> from the current feature branch, and adhere to <code>constitution.md</code>.”</li><li><strong>Claude Code / skills:</strong> Put the constitution and phase-specific instructions in a skill (e.g. <code>spec-driven/SKILL.md</code>) that says “when the user asks for a plan, read the spec from … and output a plan that respects the constitution.” Skills can point to file paths or paste key sections.</li><li><strong>Spec Kit–style commands:</strong> If you use Spec Kit or a similar CLI, the commands already encode “load this template + constitution, run the agent, write output here.” The agent is invoked with the right context by the script.</li></ul><p><strong>Summary:</strong> You do need explicit agent rules so that the same constraints and context apply every time. The “agents” can be a single coding agent (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) with phase-specific rules. Roles are effectively “which phase am I in?” and “which .md files do I load?” Coordination is achieved by passing context from markdown files—constitution always; spec and plan for plan/task/implement; tasks for implement; scenarios for validate (and optionally hidden for implement). All of this can live in the repo as .md; no separate agent-orchestration platform is required, though you can add one later (e.g. CI that runs “implement” agent with the right context and then “validate” agent) if you want full automation.</p><hr><h2 id="_9-assumptions-and-follow-up-questions" tabindex="-1">9.

This affects how to implement <code>/speckit</code>-style commands or skills.</li><li><strong>Legacy vs greenfield:</strong> What share of work is legacy (N→N+1) vs greenfield?
