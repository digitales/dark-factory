# Portfolio Workflow (many ideas, prioritised)

Goal: quickly compare multiple initiatives without deep design for all.

1) Create a shortlist list (10–20 initiatives).
2) Run /strategist first for coarse ranking using only brief intakes.
3) Select top 3–5 initiatives.
4) For selected initiatives, run full workflow:
   /architect → /dev-lead → /devops → /governance → /strategist → synthesis
5) Build a 90-day roadmap from the winners.
