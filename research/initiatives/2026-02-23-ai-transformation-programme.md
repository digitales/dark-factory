## Title
AI Transformation Programme (12-Month Strategy) — WordPress + Laravel

## Problem Statement
We need a structured AI transition programme that improves engineering efficiency, reduces legacy burden, improves observability, increases quality, enables client-facing AI value, and maintains governance and GDPR safety.

## Context
- Large legacy WordPress installs (ACF-heavy, Classic Editor)
- Laravel apps with queues, APIs, Passport auth
- Active client retainers
- Redis, MySQL, caching layers
- PHP 7.4 → 8.x transition
- UK GDPR constraints

## Objectives
1. Increase engineering efficiency
2. Reduce legacy support burden
3. Improve observability
4. Enhance code quality and test coverage
5. Create client-facing AI value where appropriate
6. Maintain governance and data safety

## Constraints
- Budget ceiling: £300/month (portfolio-level)
- No destabilisation of live client systems
- Incremental adoption
- Reversible pilots
- No autonomous production changes

## Target Outcomes (Measurable)
- PR cycle time reduction %
- Incident triage time reduction %
- Test coverage increase %
- Upgrade planning time reduction %
- Measured AI adoption rate %

## Scope
### In scope
- Internal dev tooling
- CI augmentation
- Observability improvements
- Governance framework
- Capability maturity model

### Out of scope
- Fully autonomous agents in production
- Client data ingestion into external models


## Original Research Brief

You are simulating a multi-agent AI research team designing an AI transformation strategy for a WordPress + Laravel engineering organisation.

Context:
- Large legacy WordPress installs (ACF-heavy, Classic Editor)
- Laravel apps with queues, APIs, Passport auth
- Ongoing client retainer obligations
- Mixed PHP 7.4 → 8.x upgrade path
- Redis, MySQL, caching layers
- UK-based clients with GDPR constraints
- Engineering time is limited
- AI must improve efficiency without destabilising delivery

You must simulate 5 specialised agents:

1. STRATEGIST – Focused on ROI, prioritisation, risk
2. ARCHITECT – Focused on systems design and tooling
3. DEV LEAD – Focused on implementation practicality
4. DEVOPS – Focused on infra, observability, reliability
5. GOVERNANCE – Focused on security, compliance, client impact

---

STEP 1: Each agent independently proposes top 5 AI initiatives for the team.

For each initiative include:
- Problem solved
- Estimated ROI horizon (short / medium / long)
- Risk level
- Disruption level

---

STEP 2: Debate Phase

Simulate disagreement between agents:
- Which initiatives are too risky?
- Which are unrealistic?
- Which are “shiny object syndrome”?
- Which give measurable impact within 90 days?

Summarise the debate.

---

STEP 3: Converged Output

Produce:
A. Top 3 Quick Wins (0–3 months)
B. Top 3 Structural Improvements (3–6 months)
C. 2 Long-Term Strategic Plays (6–12 months)

For each selected item include:
- Technical architecture (text diagram)
- Suggested tooling stack (real tools)
- Estimated cost range
- Pilot plan
- Success metrics
- Failure modes

---

STEP 4: Agent Orchestration Experiment Design

Design how this transformation itself could be run using agent orchestration inside Cursor.

Include:
- Role-based prompting structure
- Chained prompt workflow
- Review agent layer
- Evaluation rubric
- Cost control strategy
- How to avoid hallucinated architecture

---

STEP 5: AI Maturity Scoring

Score current assumed state (likely Level 1–2).
Define what must be true to reach Level 3 (AI-augmented workflows).

---

Output:
- Structured document
- Clear headings
- Tables where helpful
- Minimal fluff
- No marketing language
- Assume technical audience
- Prioritise realism over ambition
